# Maker_Portfolio_Colab_Code
Hello world! This is my MIT Maker Portfolio repository, which contains all the code I used for my AI projects. A couple of things:
1. All the files with the prefix "older model:" are from my initial model, which was clunky and mainly practice, so I could get accustomed to AI building.
2. The files with the prefix "rasA:" are from my revamped and better-formatted model, which I am currently working on.
3. I haven't included the data and actual model files, mostly because of how big they were. So, don't get confused by any discrepancies there.

Other than that, happy viewing!
